# Safe-game
Safe game is a gamified messaging system that can send discreet messages to other users that is undected due to a gaming front end to ensure the messages are not detected people near by. The idea for this game came to mind due to the rise in domestic violence victims during covid-19, to provide people a safe and secure way to communicate without their abusers finding out. 
Looking for a customizable game in React nature or swift. Front end will be the game which messages speak to an API back end will be user the messages from the API. Host API should use database, either Heroku or MongoDB. Programming language to write the API is TypeScript.
