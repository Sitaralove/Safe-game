The idea for this game came from the UKvsCovid-19 hack to help with the limited police resources with the rise in domestic violence victims during covid-19. It aims to provide people a safe and secure way to communicate to social organisations without alerting their abusers finding out. 

Looking for a customizable game in React nature or swift. Front end will be the game which messages speak to an API back end will be user the messages from the API. Host API should use database, either Heroku or MongoDB. Programming language to write the API is TypeScript.
