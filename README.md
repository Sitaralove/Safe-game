# Safe-game
**Safe game** is a gamified messaging system that can send discreet messages to other users that is undected due to a gaming front end to ensure the messages are not detected people near by. 

The idea for this game came from the UKvsCovid-19 hack to help with the limited police resources with the rise in domestic violence victims during covid-19. It aims to provide people a safe and secure way to communicate to social organisations without alerting their abusers. 

Currently looking for a customizable game in React nature or swift that I can work with as I have never coded before :sweat_smile:. Front end will be the game, back end will be the messaging system that will speak to an API. The end user will be able to request the messages from the API. Host API should use database, either Heroku or MongoDB. Programming language to write the API is TypeScript.
